**AnimeApp Frontend – React Native Mobile App**

This repository contains the mobile frontend for the AnimeApp project, created as part of my vocational final exam. The application is inspired by platforms like MyAnimeList, allowing users to browse, search, and rate anime content.

This mobile client is built with React Native and Expo, and was designed to communicate with a custom Node.js backend.
